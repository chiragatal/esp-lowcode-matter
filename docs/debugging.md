The ESP32-C6 microcontroller features two processing cores: the High-Performance (HP) Core and the Low-Power (LP) Core. Each core serves a specific purpose in the deviceâ€™s operation. The HP Core is primarily responsible for initializing and managing essential system functions, including the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Matter protocol stacks. Once these systems are initialized, the HP Core also loads the firmware intended for the LP Core into memory.

The LP Core, in turn, communicates with the HP Core, enabling event-driven communication where it can both send and receive events to/from the HP Core. The firmware running on the device is specifically designed for the LP Core and is typically flashed using a low-code platform.

The initialization process begins with the HP Core, which sets up the necessary communication protocols and handles the firmware loading for the LP Core. Once the HP Core has completed its tasks, the LP Core is then initialized, ready to execute the firmware that has been loaded into memory. This sequence is crucial for the proper operation of the device and must be understood when debugging any firmware issues.

The LP Core, like any processor, can encounter errors during execution that result in panic conditions. There are two primary scenarios that can cause the LP Core to panic:

## Breakpoint Panic

A breakpoint panic occurs when the LP Core firmware attempts to access null memory. An example of the panic output text is:

```sh
I (596) sys_info: ESP-AMP shared memory: addr=0x40879580, len=0x4fe0
I (603) esp-amp-loader: Reserved dram region (0x4086d560 - 0x40879560) for subcore
I (612) esp-amp-loader: Give unused reserved dram region (0x4086ec80 - 0x40879560) back to main-core heap
LP UART initialized successfully

The output above is referred to as a stack dump. To identify the specific line of code that caused the panic, you can use the MEPC address from the stack dump, which in this case is 0x4086e922. To find the corresponding line of code, execute the following command in the terminal within the product's working directory:

```sh
riscv32-esp-elf-addr2line -e <path-to-elf-file> <mepc-address>
```

(The .elf file can be found in the build directory of the compiled product.)

NOTE: Not every null memory access will trigger a breakpoint panic. The compiler will insert breakpoints during optimization to handle null memory accesses only in cases where it can detect potential null memory access at compile time. However, if a null memory access occurs at runtime, a breakpoint panic may not be triggered. This distinction is crucial for understanding the conditions under which a breakpoint panic might occur.

## Illegal Instruction Panic

An illegal instruction panic is often triggered by a type of buffer overflow, particularly when the stack pointer overflows. This occurs when a buffer (such as an array or a memory region) exceeds its allocated memory space and begins to overwrite adjacent memory areas, including critical system data like the stack pointer.

```sh

```

In this case the core dump generated may not be very useful for debugging. This is because the stack pointer or other critical memory addresses may have been corrupted, making it difficult to trace the exact point of failure from the core dump alone. As a result, the information provided in the dump may be incomplete or unreliable.

Instead, to identify the root cause of the issue, we must rely on [logging](#logging).

## Logging

* By enabling detailed logging throughout the code, especially around memory accesses and buffer operations, we can monitor the execution flow leading up to a panic. These logs provide valuable insights into the functions and operations executed prior to the overflow, helping developers identify the exact location of the buffer overflow and the affected memory addresses. This approach is crucial for diagnosing and resolving the issue, particularly when core dumps are insufficient for debugging.

* The LP core includes an implementation of the standard `printf` function, enabling log outputs to be displayed on the console.

* The LP core runs synchronously on a single thread, ensuring that all log outputs are sequential and in sync. This guarantees that log statements are printed in the exact order they are executed, making it easier to follow the execution flow and troubleshoot issues. This feature is especially useful for identifying logical errors in the firmware, as it allows developers to trace how different parts of the code interact step-by-step. By examining the log output, developers can pinpoint inconsistencies or unexpected behaviors, speeding up the process of diagnosing and resolving bugs.

## Recommended coding practices

* `Define and enforce buffer boundaries`: Always define buffer sizes explicitly, and never exceed them. Implement checks to ensure that data does not overflow past the allocated memory, especially when dealing with arrays, buffers, or memory structures.

* `Do not use memory allocation function`: using memory allocation function like malloc, calloc etc, can result in undefined behaviour, use statically allocated buffers instead. This reduces the risk of memory fragmentation and ensures that memory is used efficiently.

* `Limit pointer arithmetic`: Avoid complex pointer arithmetic that could lead to accessing unintended memory regions. Be cautious when incrementing or decrementing pointers, especially when working with buffers.

* `Avoid Deep Recursion`: Whenever possible, replace recursive functions with iterative solutions. This eliminates the risk of stack overflow, as iterative functions use a constant amount of stack space regardless of the depth of the loop.

(Note: In the case of LP firmware, illegal memory access does not always result in a panic. The firmware may not panic when reading from or writing to illegal memory. However, when reading from illegal memory, it will always return 0x0.)
